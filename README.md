# Hour of Python

Hour of Python Edits - Fixing lesson to remove dependency on "slides", changing spacing of questions with "output examples" and moving solutions.

Current list of changes:
1. Re-did cells to remove "slide" headers
2. Retitled Project, changed words on cells 3 and 4
3. Fixed numbering on 6. Comparisons (previously 5.3, etc.)
4. Camelcased the "RUN ME" variables for "7. Variables"
5. Moved Solutions to the end of the project
6. Included example output to reduce confusion and make the textbook eaiser to do self-guided.
7. Changed activity 8.5's comparison from a `!=` to a `<`
